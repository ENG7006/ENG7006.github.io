This semester, we'll be blogging with Jekyll, a hacker-ish blogging platform. This is explicitly designed to get you "close to the metal," using our coding tools for blogging, too: GitHub and Atom.

There are three Jekyll templates to choose from:
* [\*folio](https://github.com/eng7006/jekyll-folio)
* [Brume](https://github.com/eng7006/jekyll-brume)
* [Pithy](https://github.com/eng7006/jekyll-pithy)

(For reasons I didn't have time to troubleshoot this, the week before class, the Pithy live demo doesn't seem to be workingâ€”this is news to me as of an hour before class. I don't know if we'll run into trouble with this theme down the road. For now, here's [a different, Chinese (!) Pithy live demo](http://wenva.github.io/index.html).)

The readme file for each of these includes detailed instructions on how to get these to work. We'll step through it together in class this first time.

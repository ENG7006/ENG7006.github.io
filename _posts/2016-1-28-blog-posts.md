A few notes:
* First of all, thanks so very, very much for taking up the slack on Slack (yuk yuk) while I was out of town, giving a lecture.

* Second of all, thanks especially to David, who has made a helpful blogroll page, so I don't have to: [Blog_Sites](http://davidlnowak.github.io/blogsites/)

* Third of all, I've added a channel to Slack which should collate all our RSS feeds into a helpful channel. *However*, those of you using folio will need to update your sites from the eng7006/jekyll-folio repo, as apparently, I missed the part where that blog didn't come with an RSS-feed baked in. I have done the work on GitHub; you'll just need to update your branch with my new code.

* Actually, the same goes for Brume users, although that's just to update the name of your site; weird, hidden bits of Brume were coded stupidly.)

Once we get those under our belt, we should *finally* be good to go for the semester with our blogging. Thanks for your patience.

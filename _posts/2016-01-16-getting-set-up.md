This post is meant to document, and preview, some of the tech setup we'll need to do at the beginning of the semester. What every student will need to do:
1. Sign up for a GitHub account. This can be done right at [GitHub's home page](https://github.com/).

2. Email Scott (scr [at] wayne [dot] edu) your GitHub username from your preferred email account.

3. Get hooked into Slack. Scott will send you an invitation to the Slack site.

4. Get setup with Jekyll. The process is described in relative detail in the READMEs in the various Jekyll templates, e.g. [Brume](https://github.com/eng7006/jekyll-brume).

5. Finally, once all our blogs are working, sign up for a [Feedly](http://feedly.com) account. You might want to do this ahead of time, but you sure don't have to worry about it now. It won't help until we all get our blogs going.

A quick note: our coding lessons are, in fact, live. They live at:

[http://github.com/eng7006/coding-lessons](http://github.com/eng7006/coding-lessons)

As we covered in class on Thursday, and as is documented in the [Week 1 Lesson](https://github.com/ENG7006/coding-lessons/blob/master/coding-lesson-1.md), there are five dailies for this first week. Please draw five shapes in p5.js, using the [p5.js editor](http://p5js.org/download/#editor). The five shapes you should draw are:

1. A house.
2. A car.
3. A rocket.
4. A shape that moves in some fairly straightforward way.
5. A shape that does not move.

Save your work, each daily in a different folder. And please bring your work to class on a thumb drive, or email a compressed file containing all five dailies to yourself. We will go over how to turn work in in class next Thursday.

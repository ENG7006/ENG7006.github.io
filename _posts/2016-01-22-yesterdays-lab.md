I want to reflect a bit on our lab last night.

First of all, thank you very much for your patience. That did not go smoothly at all; I appreciate that you didn't mutiny.

Second of all, please know that I also understand that things didn't go exceptionally well. Jekyll took us the first 40 minutes to get setup, and that derailed our coding lesson.

Third, as I expected, we might not get through our coding practice as quickly as I had planned initially. Please know that we will revisit some of the same material next time, and I won't actually present anything from coding lesson 3 next time. We'll revisit material from lessons 1 & 2.

Fourth, please read the coding lessons very carefully on your own time. This should clarify what we did in class. It's not a bad idea to read the coding lessons twice: once before lab, once after.

Fifth, let me be very clear about our daily expectations for next time. The ```ball``` expectations are outlined in [ball](https://github.com/eng7006/ball).

As for refactoring, please revise your code according to the following spec:

* You must use variables to make the code more readable.
* Please write and call at least one function of your own.
* It is up to you if you would like to use objects. We will cover that ground again next lab.

I am sorry that my trip to Toronto falls at an inopportune time. If you felt you struggled in lab last night, please do not despair. Instead, please reach out to me: we will have a coding meetup before class on Thursday, and I will be available all day next Friday to meet.

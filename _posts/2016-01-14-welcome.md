Welcome to ENG 7006! I don't have much to say now, but keep following the blog to keep up with developments, including Feedly information, responses to commonly asked questions, changes and developments, weeks-in-review written by Scott, and other good stuff. I'll probably also write about some things that are of interest to me as we go along.

I'm delighted to be working with you guys this semester: thanks for your willingness to experiment with me.

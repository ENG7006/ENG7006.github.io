Noah: Why do we confuse phonography with people? (Why is it that the phonograph is the thing that models the nervous system, etc.?)
Aden: How does Kittler build on McLuhan?
Diana: Phonograph becoes "widely used" (at end of chapter)—how does Kittler feel about this?
David: Technological determinism? Does this (really) transform that thought?

Discussion of Guyau:
—34, 33: Guyau doesn't really get the necessary objectivity of the recording device
—Nathaniel: does Kittler think humans are technology?
—Noah: No.
—Hassan: Kittler is anti-anthropocentric. Ref: xl–xli: "Understanding media is an impossibility."
—Joe: Anti-humanism is anti rational, Cartesian, Enlightenment discourse.
—Noah: Confused by the military stuff in the latter half of "Gramophone."
—Todd: McLuhan did that, too. Is technology necessarily in the service of the Military Industrial Complex.
—Nathaniel: cf. WWI & mechanization of death, WWII & atom bomb
—Diana: Let's go back to Guyau: something about impression and observation, etc. creates new grooves on the brain, and when you encounter something you do remember it aligns in a groove you already have. Kittler goes on to argue with Guyau, actually memory isn't so special. And this is when he starts talking about time axis manipulation.
—Todd: doesn't he make that analogy about something blurry coming into focus
—Noah: Guyau was saying that the blurred image coming into focus is the speeding up of stuff—Kittler says that what happens when we listen to Guyau is that memory becomes a mechanical process?
—Courtney: Doesn't that equate humans and technology
—Nathaniel: We learn to distinguish between
—Kelly: Is there a way to distinguish between the physiological and consciousness, 37: What matters about media is that it works like physiology works; that's why he says on 34 that it doesn't matter if you're conscious to do basic physiological functions.
—Noah: phonography can't understand
—Nathaniel: conscious is like metaphysics: something above your computing brain. It can't do any meta-analysis. Who believes in that consciousness? Or metaphysics?
—Diana: I'm having trouble distinguishing memory from consciousness, but they get in the way. p. 37: there's no distance between the recorded voice and listening ears.
—Hassan: difference between art and media.
—Diana: physiology and consciousness are distinct.

—Todd: the telephone is an artificial mouth, the phonograph is an artificial ear
—Courtney: emotions?—30–31: Guyau; but this is Guyau.

—Hassan: 109: Tapes and language.
—Diana: 110: Control/negative feedback. Fighting back against control of the media.
—Noah: tape and other recording media are capture devices; taking them away from the recorded literal to the simulated literal. Last paragraph of chapter: Tape can represent things that haven't been able to come into the regime of representation before.
—Nathaniel: Writing can write none of that.
—Diana: Forward *and* backward movement of the tape.
—Noah: 91, German schizophrenic set to music; notation as working like that.
—Diana: media has already recorded what humans have already thought of. 111: the cut-up returns to its origins when...  That which humans thought they invented has been returned back to the realm of technology.
—Nathaniel: representation, he's anti, right? The symbolic is representational, it tries to organize the world. The real doesn't. Examples of chaos—schizoid, cut-up—
—Noah: Synthesizers, Stochkausen, abstract sound—
—Nathaniel: To get back to the real, you can't do that through representation.
—Diana: What kind of representation?
—Nathaniel: So abstract painting is nonrepresentational; it's not trying to represent something in the real world; Talking Heads' stop makin sense: stop trying to make everything rational and organized.
—Hassan: didn't this come out at the same time as Talking Heads'?
—Noah: 1984.
—Nathaniel: So
—Diana: There's something about the talking heads that's more representational than the abstract painting.
—Nathaniel: I can't say why he's wearing a huge suit; I can't explain it; there is no explanation for the French in "Psycho Killer"
—Noah: David Byrne recording technique: sings nonsense syllables and then write words that match the sort of sounds
—Diana: Rock stars wouldn't have done this if not for the media
—me: an anti-humanist.
—Nathaniel: It's discovery.
—Joe: As innovators, they discover possibilities in the technology
—me: discovery not invention
—Joe: If Kittler is saying that media create new circumstances, we could also say that media create new fields in which we operate and then we discover aspects, attributes of that media—what's yet to be discovered as well. Yeah, so these things are already brought to the surface; what else is tacit, already afforded by this media technology that is not yet tapped into. Thinking about software—the technology hasn't been mined/explored as much.

—David: What's the role of genius then? There are those moment o
